						The Parallel-shaped kitchen is perhaps the most efficient of all
						kitchens in terms of designing as per the necessity. It is ideally
						suited for small spaces and serves as a perfect one-cook kitchen. It
						comprises two parallel walls opposite each other with a walkway in
						between, which is why itâ€™s called as a walkthrough kitchen. The
						Parallel - shaped kitchen layout resembles a two wall galley kitchen
						layout minus a wall. The Parallel-shaped modular kitchen layout
						consists of a work space on one wall with a second, free standing
						workspace running parallel to it. Also known as the corridor style,
						this compact layout locates the appliances, sink and cabinets on two
						parallel walls to create a small pass-through kitchen.

						These cooking spaces allow you to engage your creativity to pare

						kitchen cabinets that extend to the celling.
